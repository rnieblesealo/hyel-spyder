This is a small set of principles in how the code should be treated!

Owner independence:
    - A component of a larger object should always be completely agnostic of its parent
    - If a property is needed by multiple unrelated objects (deltaTime, globalScale, etc.), pass it as a parameter when needed to avoid global variables, or use a shared instance

Composition over inheritance:
    - Entity classes hold info and functionality related to the physical object in the game world 
        - i.e. the SKSpriteNode pertaining to the object, and any properties we want to have operate on top of that 
    - Player, Spider, etc... (the dedicated classes) hold functionality that works on top of the entity, e.g. Player changes position via inputs
    - i.e. Each dedicated class will hold an entity, and then what works on top of that 

One thing, one task:
    - Specific bits of functionality (e.g. car spawning, score keeping, game speed handling) should all be handled by their own respective object
        - i.e. a ScoreKeeper to handle score and a SpeedKeeper to handle game speed, as opposed to one class that does both
