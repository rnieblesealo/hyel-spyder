-- BRAINSTORMING --

Two power-ups may have conflicting overlays; we should instantiate one per power-up
  Keep SKTexture of overlay
  Instantiate a new overlay everytime a powerup that requires it is started (fadeEffect is called...)

-- MEETING NOTES --

    - Convey to user
    - Screen effects
    - Particles, later
    - Change assets
    - Instructions page, maybe
    - Dec. 20 launch

-- FIXES --

May fix:

    - [x] Parameterize scene instead of making it a member for spawner (and wherever else is found)
    - [ ] Indexing textures requires unwrapping, make it so it doesn't?

Will fix:

    - [ ] Stuff keeps spawning after closing the app (in general, everything blows up when we close the app...)
    - [ ] Onscreen powerups keep moving after gameover, and possibly aren't cleared
    - [ ] Something seems to be up with speed resetting, fix!

-- TODOS --

- [x] Blanks
- [ ] Spider-swatter
- [ ] Slowdown
