-- BRAINSTORMING --

Power-ups:
    RNG:
        - Keep probability table, 1-100
        - A range represents an action
        - Gen. random number and evaluate against this table
            e.g. 0-10 corresponds to spawning some powerup, so if I roll a 5, I'll do that
    Activation
        - On collide with powerup, check its effect; the effect is an enum defined per object; it's not the name of the powerup in case we want to change it later
        - Powerups have an effective duration, use a timer; if the powerup acts instantaneously, make that timer's duration 0 
        - There will be callbacks at the beginning + end of the timer, following a set -> unset pattern
        - For now, make all powerups trigger instantaneously, but the idea is to make the blank act on doubletap
        - If the player collects a powerup that's currently in effect, reset that powerup's run timer to 0 
         
        Summary:
            1. On collide, check type 
            2. Depending on type, run a series of setter callbacks bound to a timer
            3. Use a finish block to unset what the callbacks did after the timer expires
            
Checking ranges:
    - Keep a table of items mapped to a weight w
    - From this initial table, generate new table, where each item will exist w times
    - And now just choose a random item from the table!

-- FIXES --

May fix:
    - [x] Parameterize scene instead of making it a member for spawner (and wherever else is found)
    - [ ] Indexing textures requires unwrapping, make it so it doesn't?

Will fix:
    - [ ] Stuff keeps spawning after closing the app (in general, everything blows up when we close the app...)
    - [ ] Onscreen powerups keep moving after gameover, and possibly aren't cleared
